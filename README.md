# vi-xournalpp
This is a tiny plugin for Xournal++ for version >=1.1
(which has yet to see a full release).
It is inspired by the modal editing popularized
by the text editor vi. 

# Modes
The modes are

1. `t`: Tool mode
2. `c`: Color mode

Tool mode is used for switching between the different tools,
and color mode is used to switch between the different colors.

# Tool mode
The keybindings for tool mode are

1. `w`: Pen tool (w is for write)
2. `e`: Eraser tool
3. `f`: Highlighter tool (f is for fat)
4. `s`: Selection tool

# Color mode
The keybindings for color mode are

1. `r`: Red
2. `o`: Orange
3. `y`: Yellow
4. `g`: Green
5. `c`: Cyan
6. `b`: Blue
7. `p`: Purple
8. `q`: Pink
9. `w`: White

Selecting a color in color mode, 
e.g. entering `cy` for selecting yellow,
automatically returns you to tool mode.
